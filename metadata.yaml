description: |
  Zinc is a search engine that does full text indexing. It is a lightweight alternative to
  elasticsearch and runs in less than 100 MB of RAM. It uses bluge as the underlying indexing
  library.

  It is very simple and easy to operate as opposed to elasticsearch which requires a couple dozen
  knobs to understand and tune.

  It is a drop-in replacement for elasticsearch if you are just ingesting data using APIs and
  searching using kibana (Kibana is not supported with zinc. Zinc provides its own UI).
